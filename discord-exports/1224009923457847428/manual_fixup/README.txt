This folder contains manual typed-by-hand JSON imports to manipulate the
nickname-to-ID assignments the tool parses.

Some of the users changed their nicknames in a way that is intransparent to the
tool as Discord does not retain those old nicknames if an import started to
late.

We reintroduce the old nickname properly into the system through these JSON
documents.
